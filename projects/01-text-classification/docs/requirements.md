# Text Classification Project Requirements

## Project Overview
Build a production-ready text classification system that demonstrates both classical ML and modern deep learning approaches, with interpretable results and production-grade deployment.

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: > 85% on test set
- **F1-score**: > 0.80 for each category
- **Inference Time**: < 100ms per prediction
- **Model Size**: < 1GB for deployment

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Pipeline
- Handle missing or malformed text
- Process at least 10,000 documents
- Support both batch and streaming inputs
- Implement data validation checks
- Track data versioning

#### Model Implementation
1. Classical Approach
   - Implement TF-IDF vectorization
   - Train at least 3 different models
   - Create ensemble combining best performers
   - Feature importance analysis

2. Modern Approach
   - Fine-tune BERT-based model
   - Optimize for production use
   - Compare performance with classical approach
   - Document trade-offs

#### Model Interpretation
- SHAP values for feature importance
- LIME explanations for individual predictions
- Visualization dashboard for interpretability
- Confidence scores for predictions

#### Deployment
- RESTful API with Flask
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Basic authentication
- Logging and monitoring
- Health checks

### API Specifications
